# airline-ife
This project is a simple in-flight entertainment (IFE) style web application that simulates the seat-back screens you see on airplanes.

It includes:

A Movies section with a built-in video player that plays local media files.

A Games section featuring a Uno-style card game with 4 players (you vs 3 basic AI bots).

The interface is designed to feel like an airline IFE system: side navigation, separate sections for Home, Movies, and Games, and a clean dark UI optimized for fullscreen use.

The entire project is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any external frameworks, and was designed and developed with the assistance of ChatGPT (GPT-5.1 Thinking).
